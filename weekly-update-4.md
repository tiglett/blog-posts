# Weekly update [11/11/2013]
This week I delegated the task of making prototypes to several members of the Java team:

Oddie – MainAppActivity
Theo – WalkDetailsActivity
Lars – LocationActivity
Dan – WalkCreatorActivity

I will be prototyping an implementation of the IWalkController interface.

Once these activities have been prototypes we can start working on the Controller and Model packages. The prototped Activities will allow us to start testing prototyping and testing the other components of the application as the UI will be ready to interact with.

Hours spent this week:
  - Internal meeting: 1 hour
  - Design meeting: 1 hour
  - Total this week: 1 hours
  - Total so far: 11 hours
