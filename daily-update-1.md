# Daily update [27/01/2014]
Now that it’s testing & integration week, it looks like daily updates will be more sensible.

Today I spent my time delegating Android development tasks, helping out with git & Android in the group, and working on the app.

I managed to get the app recording GPS coordinates and updating the UI, as well as making several bug fixes throughout the app.

The app is now much closer to being finished than it started this morning. All that we need to do now is add the ability to take pictures with the camera, fix bugs relating to adding Points of Interest, get the Walk’s data into JSON, and fix some UI bugs.

I spent quite a bit of time today working on the GPS code whilst not sure whether it was my code or the Android emulator at fault. After fighting with the emulator to simulate GPS data, i’ve now switched to simply self-signing the app and testing it straight on my phone.

Hours spent today:
  - 9am-5pm work in B23: 7 hours
  - Additional time after 5: 1 hour
  - Total so far: 29 hours
