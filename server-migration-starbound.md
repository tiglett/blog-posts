# Server migration and Starbound
After salvaging my old posts using  google's page caching feature, I've managed to get the blog back to how it used to be.
I also have up-to-date packages now that I've ditched CentOS and switched to Fedora, too.

Now that I can run python 2.7, I've got my Starbound server running with the StarryPy server management software.
