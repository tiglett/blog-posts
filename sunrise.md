# Sunrise
Over the past few days I've decided I want to make a website.

It's (hopefully) going to be a forum/message board allowing both registered accounts and anonymous posts.

Users can create their own forums/boards, and can choose whether they want to allow anonymous users, registered users, or only members to create threads/posts.

So far I've got a user login/registration system working with php/mariaDB, and the site looks a little like this:

The panels at the bottom are static placeholders at the moment, but that will change soon.

Well, that's all for now. I'll post an update again when I've fleshed it out enough to host it here.
