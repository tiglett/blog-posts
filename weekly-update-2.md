# This week's update [28/10/2013]
This week I was in charge of creating the first draft of the UML use-case diagrams for our mobile app and web app.

I decided to split it into two diagrams, one covering the interaction with the app and the other covering interaction with the server.

Whilst designing the use-cases I looked at the QA specification for what the app must be able to do in order to cover everything expected of it. This allowed me to accurately model our apps’ use-cases and ensure that there was nothing missing from the functionality of it, and no extra functionality that is not required. I do not want to add any extra functionality as it would not gain us any extra marks and would not be following what we were told to create. It could also cost us valuable development time.

I feel that it’s extremely important when designing the use-cases to be very specific about the interaction between users/systems because it is these basic designs that will influence the class diagrams and code further along the design process. If any mistakes are made here then they will trickle down into the code and could end up causing either a messy code base or, if we are particularly unlucky, a necessary re-write.

Well that’s about it for this week.
