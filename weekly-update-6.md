# Weekly update [25/11/2013]
This week I updated the wikiâ€™s Design page

This involved making a write-up for every package, every class in every package, and every method in every class. I also had to write out a textual description of any major algorithms involved in our program.

This was fairly time consuming but should hopefully clear up what each class is for and will help others to create sequence/component diagrams.

 
Hours spent this week:

 * Internal meeting: 1 hour
 * Updating design page to include algoritms and class/method description: 3 hours
 * Total this week: 4 hours
 * Total so far: 17 hours
